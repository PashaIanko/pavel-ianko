  summary: |
    Hello! How are you? ðŸ˜Š

    My name is Pavel, I'm a Modelling Analyst at ABN AMRO bank in Amsterdam.

    I have a stable salary in a top Dutch bank, hence **I pay the rent in time**.
    In addition, I have **4 years** experience of living in a
    shared dormitory during my Bachelor's studies, as well
    as **2 years** of renting history in Italy. For the next **5 years** I rent a studio apartment in Amsterdam.

    I can provide all necessary proofs and documents upon your request. Since they contain
